# eucrac-rights-assertion
EUCRAC is a citizen-led prototype for a digital EU Rights Assertion Certificate — portable, self-issued, and legally grounded documentation to help mobile EU citizens prove and exercise their rights to live, work, and move freely across the Union. Built with digital signatures, legal citations, and GDPR compliance by design.

# EUCRAC – EU Rights Assertion Certificate

**EUCRAC** is a digital rights assertion platform designed to bridge the gap between EU citizenship rights and real-world enforcement. It allows mobile EU citizens to self-generate digitally signed certificates referencing their legal rights to live, work, and move freely within the European Union. Inspired by the COVID Digital Certificate model, EUCRAC provides a portable, verifiable, privacy-respecting way to assert lawful presence and equal treatment without waiting for official recognition or legal intervention.

This is democratic infrastructure: not a replacement for rights, but a rights amplifier. 

## 🔄 How It Works

EUCRAC certificates are generated through a web-based tool and cryptographically signed using the user's national eID (e.g. Estonian e-Residency). Each certificate contains:

- Your EU nationality (not your passport number)
- The legal basis for your right (TFEU Articles 21 and 45, Directive 2004/38/EC)
- A tamper-proof QR code for instant verification
- A digital signature compliant with [eIDAS Regulation](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas)

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Visit the EUCRAC generator (coming soon at `eucrac.eu`)
2. Log in with your eID (e.g. Estonian e-Residency, German AusweisApp, etc.)
3. Select the purpose (job seeking, housing, banking, etc.)
4. Generate a signed PDF or JSON certificate
5. Present the certificate to a service provider/employer/coworking space
6. If rejected, generate an official complaint letter with legal references

> You never share sensitive personal data — only verified legal standing.

## 💡 Vision

We believe that:
- **Citizenship should not be invisible.**
- **Legal rights are meaningless if you can’t prove them.**
- **A digital Europe must work for people, not just institutions.**

EUCRAC is an 80/20 solution to a 100% structural failure — building the missing documentation layer that enables citizens to exercise their rights directly.
