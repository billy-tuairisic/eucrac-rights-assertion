# EUCRAC – EU Rights Assertion Certificate

**EUCRAC** is a citizen-led, open-source prototype for a digital **EU Rights Assertion Certificate** — a lightweight, privacy-respecting way for mobile EU citizens to prove and exercise their legal rights to live, work, and move freely across the Union.

Inspired by the COVID Digital Certificate, EUCRAC is not a visa or residence permit. It is a portable, digitally signed summary of rights grounded in existing EU law — designed for everyday use in housing, employment, and services, where discrimination or misunderstanding often block legal access.

This is not a new right. It is a clear, verifiable signal that **your EU rights already exist**.

## 🔧 What It Does

- ✅ Asserts lawful presence under **TFEU Art. 21** and **Directive 2004/38/EC**
- 🔒 Uses your **EU national eID** (e.g. Estonian e-Residency) to verify identity
- 🧾 Generates a **QR-verifiable certificate** for use with landlords, employers, institutions
- ⚖️ Creates **legal references and complaint templates** if access is denied

---

## 🚫 What It Does Not Do

- ❌ Does not issue new rights or override Member State authority
- ❌ Does not store or expose sensitive personal data
- ❌ Does not replace national registration or residence requirements

---

## 🌍 Why It Exists

Millions of EU citizens live across borders, yet face barriers to housing, jobs, and services — not due to lack of rights, but lack of proof. EUCRAC bridges that gap:

> **“I was sent to immigration in Hungary despite having full EU rights. If I had this, I could have asserted my status on the spot.”**

EUCRAC is a **people-first rights amplifier**, not a legal workaround. It brings existing rights into the digital age, where decisions are made quickly — often by private actors who have never read EU law.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Visit the certificate generator (coming soon at `eucrac.eu`)
2. Log in with a national eID (e.g. Estonian, German, etc.)
3. Select your basis (worker, jobseeker, family member, etc.)
4. Generate a digitally signed certificate with QR code
5. Use it during job applications, housing processes, or banking
6. If rejected, auto-generate a complaint letter citing EU law

> All output is GDPR-compliant and pseudonymised where possible. Your identity is cryptographically signed, not exposed.

## 💡 Vision

- **Citizenship shouldn’t be invisible.**
- **Your rights shouldn’t depend on luck, accent, or passport aesthetics.**
- **A digital Europe must protect people, not just borders.**

EUCRAC is an **80/20 solution** to a 100% enforcement gap — low-cost, rights-based infrastructure that empowers citizens without waiting for official permission.

> “Designed to require minimal back-end integration, EUCRAC enables Member States or platforms to adopt or endorse certificates without infrastructure overhaul — accelerating path-to-impact.”
