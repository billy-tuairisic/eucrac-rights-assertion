# eucrac-rights-assertion
EUCRAC is a citizen-led prototype for a digital EU Rights Assertion Certificate â€” portable, self-issued, and legally grounded documentation to help mobile EU citizens prove and exercise their rights to live, work, and move freely across the Union. Built with digital signatures, legal citations, and GDPR compliance by design.
